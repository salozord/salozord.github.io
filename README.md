# Personal WebPage
Â¡Hi! Mi name is Santiago Salazar. The web page that you will find in this repository pretends to talk about me, apart from other stuff related with my studies, preferences, personal projects and much more.

## Libraries or External Code/Elements
The following libraries or external code/elements were used apart from my own work during the development of this webpage:
* Bootstrap [visit the site](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/download/)
* Fontawesome icons free [visit their site](https://fontawesome.com/)
* Radio D3.js Spider Chart [visit the site](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/21746a9668ffdf6d8242)
* CSS smooth scroll reference for my website [visit the site](https://css-tricks.com/sticky-smooth-active-nav/)
### IMPORTANT TO READ
The final charts are not going to be responsive directly if the width is changed. They both depend on reloading the hole website and on the size of the viewport's width at that moment. To see the responsiveness of those charts, is then necessary to reload the website. The file ```viejo.html``` is just an old reference so please don't even open it.
The charts also are not visible in IE because of the lack of compatibility. IE represents less than 3% of the world's browsers. Nevertheless, my site is almost fully functional on IE.

## Page's Domain (URL)
The page is live, runing in the URL [santiagosalazar.me](https://santiagosalazar.me) which is pointing to this repository on github. This means that accessing to the URL [salozord.github.io](https://salozord.github.io) will redirect successfully to the domain mentioned above.
