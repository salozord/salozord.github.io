# Personal WebPage
Â¡Hi! Mi name is Santiago Salazar. The web page that you will find in this repository pretends to talk about me, apart from other stuff related with my studies, preferences, personal projects and much more.

## Libraries or External Code/Elements
The following libraries or external code/elements were used apart from my own work during the development of this webpage:
* Fontawesome icons free [visit their site](https://fontawesome.com/)
* Radio D3.js Spider Chart [visit the site](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/21746a9668ffdf6d8242)

## Page's Domain (URL)
The page is live, runing in the URL [santiagosalazar.me](https://santiagosalazar.me) which is pointing to this repository on github. This means that accessing to the URL [salozord.github.io](https://salozord.github.io) will redirect successfully to the domain mentioned above.
